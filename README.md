### Overview

We have been asked to build an all encompassing full stack project with an Angular front end and Spring Boot back end. Students were asked to build a full stack web application that encompassed full C.R.U.D capability. The project was to use a database that we built from the ground up and uses Tomcat Web Container to run on a local server as well as being deployed to AWS.
MedTrak is a Patient/Provider Interface that allows a patient and provider access to patient information. Utilizes restful services to provide a single, dependable source for patient healthcare providers to access their patients' medication lists and health history.
